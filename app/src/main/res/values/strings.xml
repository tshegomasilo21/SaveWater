    <string name="critical_body">We\'ve all grown up taking water for granted. Turned on the tap and there\'s water. Flushed the toilet and there\'s water. Take a bath. Put on the dishwasher.\n\nWe all use water without really thinking about it, but now we need to change our ways! We\'re at the tipping point of needing to take a more active role in reducing the amount of water we use; otherwise we will ultimately suffer higher water bills.\n\nIt\'s only a matter of time before water conservation goes the same way as recycling of household waste. Both are issues: recycling came about because we need to conserve the world\'s natural resources and reduce waste. In the same way, changes in weather patterns and the effects of global warming have had such a dramatic effect on the countries water supply that scarcity and cost are becoming increasingly important issues for all of us.\n\nWater conservation means using our water wisely and caring for it properly. Since each of us depends on water for life, it is our responsibility to learn more about water conservation and how we can help keep our water pure and safe for generations to come.\n\nOur water supply is finite, which means that we do not have an endless supply. We only have the water that we have now. Ninety - seven percent of all the water on the earth is salt water which is not suitable for drinking. Only three percent of all the water is fresh water, and only one percent is available for drinking water. The other two percent is locked in ice caps and glaciers.\n\nWe must learn to save water now for the future. The quality of our water is very important. We have the same amount of water now as there was when the earth was created.\n\nThis is the water we have, and we must preserve its quality. Water is the foundation of food and life. Next to air, water is our most precious resource. Saving water helps to preserve our environment. It reduces the energy required to process and deliver water, which helps in reducing pollution and in conserving fuel resources.\n\nSaving water now means having water available in the future for recreational purposes, too. Conserving the water we have minimizes the effects of water shortages and helps build a better defence against future drought years. If we save water now, we are helping to ensure a water supply adequate for future generations. Saving water saves money.</string>
